## TechTrade
 This algorithmatic trading model utilizes technical indicators KDJ and MACD as the trading strategy. It then extracts by default 14 weeks of data from Alpha Vantage and identifies S&P500 stocks that meets the criteria. The model will then suggest buying or selling certain stocks based on the given criteria. Moreover, the model could also plot KDJ and MACD for stocks with past 14 weeks of full historical data provided.
 
 *The model includes three MACD algorithms for reference but only one was used as the other two has lower accuracies throughout
